# UI Automation Script - Search Feature

## Framework & Language

This automation script is written using **JavaScript** with the **Cypress** framework.

## Scenario Automated

The test focuses on the **Search** feature of the application. This scenario was chosen because it represents common user interactions such as:

- Typing input into a search field
- Triggering dynamic results
- Validating that the expected results are rendered correctly

Although only the Search functionality is automated, this scenario demonstrates the ability to write clean, functional UI automation code using Cypress.

## Project Structure

The test is structured using Cypress conventions, including:

- Use of `describe` and `it` blocks for test organization
- Clear selectors and assertions
- Reusable commands where appropriate

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
   ```bash
    npm install cypress
   ```
3. Run the test in Cypress UI:
   ```bash
    npx cypress open
   ```
5. Run the test headlessly:
   ```bash
    npx cypress run
   ```
